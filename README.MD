Figure 51 is the best comparing to the others:
1. It contains multiple plots (9) in one single figure comparing to the single plot in Figure 0 to 10.
2. The information of Figure 51 is right into the topic comparing to Figure 11 to Figure 30 - though they have multiple plots in one figure and try to have some indications from the scatter and hist plots, the purpose is not ideally achieved.
3. Figure 51 also highlights the interaction between variables while Figure 31 - 40 only present single variable histogram.
4. The plots require sorted data which is missing from Figure 41 to 50.
5. Figure 51 also provides 3-D visualizations in order to check wheather some of the factors would help(hurt) the existing factors
6. It clearly shows that BMI, BP and S3 are the main factor while explaining the variances of Y. Surprisingly, SEX and AGE does not provide much significance here.
